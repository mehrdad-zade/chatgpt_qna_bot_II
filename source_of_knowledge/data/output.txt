Avoid toxic relationships. Just avoid them. They ruin people's lives. They'll ruin your life. Like just do your best to be in healthy relationships and then everything's good. And I don't say that lightly. Like, that's a big one. I've seen so many people who were doing great, but because they got caught up in some drama, they just nose dived the whole thing., Get more. Get sunlight in your eyes in the morning, especially on cloudy days, as many days of your life as you can, and make it a pleasureful thing. Yeah, right. Just get up and get outside. Get out on the porch. Get outside. You know, take sunglasses. Just do it right most days, if not every day., Try and get your sleep right now. Younger people with different schedules like don't give up a social life, but you know, try and get a good amount of sleep. Get good at that. Some people are great sleepers, some people are., Very good idea., If you want to be healthy, to do three days a week of weight training, we're talking about 10 minutes of warm up and 50 to 60 minutes of working out. If you want, we have a a schedule like a that encompasses all this. That's on hubermanlab.com. You get it free. There's nothing to sell here. It's just like a fitness toolkit that we have a sleep toolkit. All that. Zero cost. You just downloads a PDF 3 pages so you don't have to listen to me talk. Yeah. Then I would say three days a week of resistance training and train your legs, guys. Come on and., Three days a week of some cardiovascular work. But people might say, well, listen, I'm in my 20s or 30s. Like, I'm not worried about it. It's not about being worried about heart attack, it's about maintaining blood flow to everything. What is some cardiovascular? OK, so I think one day a week you take a long slow jog or pedal on the bike or treadmill or swim, whatever. Your favorite thing is if you want to make it social and you're out with somebody, you could literally get one like wear weight vests for a hike if you wanted to make it harder, but you could skip rope, whatever the other cardio day Sprint., It's really easy. Find a patch of land, Sprint for 30 seconds to 45 seconds. Then walk back for a minute to 90 seconds. Sprint again. Do that five to 10 times till by by the end you will have increased your speed, your VO2 Max, your output. And then another day maybe do something fun like take I got a friend, he's a musician, I won't name. His name is well known musician. He's like really into Pilates right now, probably for a bunch of reasons. Loves Pilates. He's like, yo, I'm loving Pilates and these Pilates, some other cardiovascular thing that's kind of fun., It could be basketball, yeah. Could be scared like something that you enjoy at least three days a week and the other days weight training. It's not complicated. And then one day a week just take off as a recovery day. And the way to organize this so that your legs are covered in time for the Sprint Day and your sprints are kind of double as leg day. We have an episode on this called Toolkit for Fitness. You don't have to watch it, you will just have our fitness toolkit lays out the schedule, exercise selection, rest sets, all that. Super easy. It's minimal time commitment and listen. There are reasons to do it for aesthetic reasons. The reason to do it for heart health., Is this is key? OK, so sunlight that I think., Have some tool to be able to control your stress. Some people are super mellow, but some non pharmaceutical tool. The double inhale through the nose, the physiological size so big deep inhale through the nose, then sneak in a little bit more air than dump all your air with your mouth. That's the fastest way to calm down if you're scared of public speaking. If you you know you're tense about something interaction and listen, if I can't bring you on board with that way, listen, I'll just be very direct. You want to delay orgasm?, Works for that too because remember orgasm is a increase in the what we call the sympathetic tone of the nervous is actually kind of like the stress response and then comes the relaxation afterwards. So you know sort of like if you need like a an incentive well and in the tantric community they talk about using this type of breathing to to for couples to be able to have sex for long periods of time to be able to explore the different forms of of sensual connection. So there you go like got sunlight exercise stress control through physiological double inhale long., Sail through the mouth. Try and be a nose breather and not a mouth breather., Listen, I also think it's a really good idea. In addition to seeking good social connection, etcetera, I think it's good to have some practice that makes you more resilient. And I'm a big fan of cold showers and ice baths and cold. They have great banyas here in New York and you know, put yourself into uncomfortable cold three or five days a week. It's not about the metabolism increase as much as is the mental training of doing something that sucks. I mean, David Goggins has this right. And actually this brings us back to this the., The importance of story, I mean David is a guy who just keeps pushing himself and pushing himself to do the hard thing. But I think the reason he's so effective as a communicator is because we understand that he had to go through a journey that was incredible from being this 300 plus pound guy to that and he's still doing it. So we're like in his story, he's still going. And so I think all of us would do well to., Yeah, they'll push ourselves to be uncomfortable. And then when the cold, what's beautiful is after you get out of the cold and I like to end on warm shower, you do a minute or three minutes of of cold or getting the ice bath or whatever it is, you get this huge long lasting surge in dopamine that sets your mood and your positivity for hours and hours. This has been shown by data. And so I think it's a wonderful tool and it's listen, these are basically 0 cost tools. They take time. I wish I developed these tools in my 20s. I built them gradually. I've been working out a long time and little things here and there. But if you start them., Really. Yeah. They stay with you. And I always think the best way to outperform everybody in your business, or at least keep up in very competitive business. And Joe Rogan is a beautiful example of this, is to take excellent care of your health. He's, I mean, think about 3:00 or 4/4 hour podcasts a week, plus the comedy thing. But it's a superhuman plus UFC, you're doing this like people who are really good at their craft invest in taking really good care of themselves. And then of course that includes avoid toxic relationships. Just avoid them. They ruined people's lives. They'll ruin your life., Like, just do your best to be in healthy relationships and then everything's good. And I don't say that lightly. Like, that's a big one. I've seen so many people who were doing great, but because they got caught up in some drama, they just nose dive the whole thing. So those would be the recommendations. There are a bunch of others and I'll keep spouting them out on the Internet.,
